# Automatically quantifying knee osteoarthritis severity from X-ray images using a faster R-CNN model #
 
This code respoitory can be used to automatically quantify knee osteoarthritis severity from X-ray images using a trained faster region convolutional neural network (R-CNN) model. 

A majority of the code repsoitory is borrowed from [Faster R-CNN](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn) by Shaoqing Ren, Kaiming He, Ross Girshick and Jian Sun.
